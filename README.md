# Building Engines Mid-Market UI

## Getting Started

4. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Available Commands

- `npm run dev` - start the development server
- `npm run prod` - start the production server
- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder
- `npm run build` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint and stylelint check
- `npm test` - run all tests and execute coverage report
- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode

## Technology stack:

Yes, this is a VERY opinionated starter. It's not for everyone to use, and it definitely won't fit all projects requirements. If your project is rather simple and has few resouces/screens, this may not be worth the while. However, if it's a larger project and you know or are willing/interested in learning all technologies, it will make your life a lot prettier.
